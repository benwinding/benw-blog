As phones become more integrated into our lives, some businesses are recognizing that tradtional services may be redundant. We found this out the hard way, while ordering a pizza ...

## The Rise of the Food Apps

The fast food industry has dramatically changed in recent years. Many of the big players have increased development and promotion of their mobile apps and ordering systems. 

In my city - (Adelaide, Australia) - there are several new methods of ordering food online:

- Uber Eats - Food App - Released 2016
- OTR - Coffee App - Released 2016
- McDonalds - In Store Kiosk - Released 2016

Each provides a stream-lined way to order, pay and obtain food. However, a lot of these businesses themselves still provide services the old fashioned way, walk-in traffic.

### Discovering the pizza store

We recently ordered a pizza from a new pizza shop called *Hey Bianca*. My partner Ally discovered them online *(via Instagram cause we're hip!)*, she then ordered the pizza from their website. However she noticed that there was no phone number visible on the website, and know way to contact the store, which seemed a little strange. But they stated they do pickup, so I was intending to pick up the pizza on the way home from work.

### Finding the store

I looked at the website and at first glance, I was not able to easily find the location of this pizza store. This was pretty odd, as it was a modern website for a pizza store, and one of the main reasons you search a business up is to find it, right?

On a closer inspection, I found the location at the very bottom of the page. It was not highlighted and seemed as if it was placed there for legal reasons. This intrigued me, so I set off to find the Pizza Shop!

### Spotting the store

I remembered the highly branded advertisements we found on Instagram, so I looked for these logos on the street. Big pizza signs or lights, but I couldn't easily see the store. 

After driving past it twice (It was raining, I'm dumb), I finally noticed that the pizza place was a tiny shop without any traditional signs.

It was weird that the small sign blocked the door (which was actually locked). But when I looked through the window I could see why. The entire Pizza Shop was actually just a big kitchen! So there was no room for customers to order or wait inside.

So, I knocked on the door and a chef came up to window and started talking to me. They said they're entire business is online-based and that pickup was only a courtesy for some customers in apartments across the road. They apologized that I couldn't come in, but I happily waited on the street until my pizza was ready, then took it home to Ally.

# Analysis of the "Online-Only Food" Business Model

Although I had to wait in the cold, I was impressed on the efficiency of the business. So I'm going to look at the business model in a little more detail to weigh up how good a 100% online food store could go. 

## Benefits
There are many savings that I could spot in why this business model could be competitive against traditional fast food. Some of the benefits include:

| **Saving**        | **Why**       |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Order Automation  | All orders processed through automated systems; app, website. |
| Cheaper Overhead  | Less electricity, services used, cleaning as no customers are visiting the store |
| Cheaper wages     | No staff needed to serve customers |
| More kitchen      | As no store space needed for dining/waiting |
| Less rennovations | No signage or cosmetic rennovations required to the property, as it will never be seen by customers! |
| Cheaper locations | As all business is driven by online sales, the location is not as important as it isn't consumer facing. |

These are huge savings for a business, which means they can pour more money into more important things LIKE THEIR PRODUCT! ... asside from focusing on making better pizzas, they can also spend more money on online advertising and web development too.

## Risks
This all sounds great right!? Well as with any business, it's important to analyze the risks, especially internet based businesses. And an online business has quite a few. Some risks include:

| **Risk**        | **Why**       |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Less Personal   | Do to all sales and feedback being online, the business needs to work to know it's customers |
| Delivery Time   | Due to the _temporal_ nature of pizza, delievery is a crucial part of the business |
| Internet Uptime | The business is 100% reliant on an active connection between them and their customers. If ethier one goes down, so does that sale and possibly reputation. |
| Quality Feedback | All customers will likely see reviews of the store (as they are online anyway), so negative online reviews will have an enormous effect on the sales. |

So it is clear theat compared to a traditional pizza shop, there are many risks that could affect the business.

## Incentives for the business
There are many reasons that a business might want to use this model.

| **Incentive**        | **Why**       |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Less Costs   | Reduces initial investment on property, less employees, less running costs. |
| Greater Quality  | Due to the higher emphasis on the online reviews, there's a bigger incentive on the quality of the product. |
| Better Online Presence  | More focus on a web presence |

## Conclusion
It seems that the main benefit is that the business it self is not costumer facing. So only the product and delivery service needs to be focused on, rather than the look and hospitality of business.

I believe this model would be ideal for businesses looking to franchise out in certain areas as all the benefits apply and most risks are mitigated; due to the established brand and reputation.

## Future Predictions
In the future I believe that many of these little online-only kitchens will exist scattered around highly populated areas. The incentives are high are running costs are low. 

It may even be a market that could be led by chefs and delivery drivers themselves. Imagine if chefs could clock and in and out of work just like Uber drivers!

Thoughts? Let me know if I missed anything in the comments.
