Frank was a good dog. I valued his existence and am sad that he is gone. But during his 3 years with me he taught me so much...

<!-- more -->

Frank always loved playing with ropes, he developed a game that he could play by himself. He'd swing the rope around like a hammer-throwing olympian. 

> He taught me that you can make your own fun, and something as boring as a piece of rope, could keep you entertained.

Frank would celebrate your arrival, he was always excited when someone new came to the house, or when one of us came home.
> He taught me that seeing your friends and family should be celebrated as you never know the last time you'll see them.

Frank was fit, he loved exercise, he didn't care if it was rainy or sunny he would be excited to go on a walk in any weather.
> He taught me that to listen to my body and prioritize exercise as it's always more important than staying comfy in dry clothes.

Frank was determined but empathetic, he would love playing tug of war with other dogs and people. He wanted to prove his strength, but would rather keep the game going than win. He would change his strength according to his opponent.
> He taught me that it's often the game that's fun and to sometimes it's better to play to other people's abilities (even it you could easily win) to make it more fun for everyone.

Frank was attentive and clever, he'd constantly be looking at your face trying to understand commands and emotion in order to get a treat.
> He taught me that listening to someone and reading their emotions is an important part of intelligence and dealing with other people.

He was special to me, but these lessons aren't exclusive to Frank.

Love your pets... but more importantly learn from them.

Goodbye Frank
