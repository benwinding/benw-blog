There's been many recent revolutions in writing technologies, and I thought it would be interesting to compare them and the way they affect the author's ideas.

We can break down the act of *writing* into several technological categories. Each form builds on the previous technology.

### Hand written

Somewhere in the beginning there was "cave painting", and some time after came written language. The benefit's of "hand writing" is complete stream of thought, what you are thinking goes directly onto the page. In an isolated context nothing is influencing your idea, but mistakes are also recorded directly too.

### Typewriter

Then came the type writer, a device to make typing easier and more uniform. This allows you to focus on the *content* rather than the visual *aesthetic* of your writing. This also has the consequence of reducing everyone to the single visual style produced by the machine.

### Computers

A relatively short time later, computers were invented and writers loved them. You could actually modify the text before committing it to the paper. You could also edit the visual style relatively easy with this thing called *fonts!*.

### Autocomplete

An extension on the *Computer idea* is the invention of "Autocomplete", which was basic AI suggestion built into some word processors and email clients. This allows the writer to simply press the `tab` key in order to *automatically* write the computer's suggestion. Sometimes it was right, sometimes it was way off, but you would usually always see the computer suggesting something to you, which could influence your style and what you're thinking of next.

### Generative AI Prompts

From the bleeding edge of writer's technology comes *Generative AI Prompts*. These systems expand on your input, and can output many paragraphs of well-written original content, based only on a single sentence. Truly incredible technology, but almost entirely removes the writer's *style* and *stream of thought* from the process.

Here's a table summarizing my thought's on each piece of *writing tech*:

It's clear that these AI generative tools are great in excelling at all surface-level metrics. They're easy to use, just type a request like you would to an employee and get a result. The output is always grammatically error-free with no misspelled words (*facts are another matter*). And compared to writing something yourself, they are extremely fast.

However, they aren't great at expressing your personality as they're trained on other people's work. And even though you can quickly iterate to get what you want, you're being subconsciously influenced by the suggestions given by the AI. Which means you're not actually recording your stream of thought. These two points are what arguably what gives humanity to your writing.

The advancements in writing technology are amazing and have given individuals incredible power to produce high quality content. I just hope people still enjoy the act of writing in the future.
