A quote recently stood out to me today and revealed a deep misunderstanding about the classic the quote, "The glass is half full!".

<!-- more -->

One of the earliest instances of this expression can be found in this television advertisement in the 1960's promoting the peace core.

This quote is quite powerful but shallow way to divide postive and negative outlooks on life. This expression was once inciteful, but has burried itself deep into popular culture that it's now annoying.

## Alernative Quotes

So, I recently glanced at a quote that struck me as a very concise way to bridge the two perspectives on life, rather than divide them.

{% blockquote James Branch Cabell, 1926 %}
The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true...
{% endblockquote %}

In my opinion, this quote gives a deeper representation of these two outlooks. It's not divisive and actually reconciles both beliefs a lot clearer. It can be said that the glass question divides people into full OR empty answers. However this quote has a better emphasis on unifying both outlooks... the world is the best AND it's depressing that could be true.

<!-- 
So;
if(The glass is half full?)
  Positive
  *Good to have more*;
else
  Pessimistic;
  *Bad to have less*;
End;

So;
if (Is this world the
**best** possible world?)
  Positve
  *This world's great*;
else
  Pessimistic
  *This world's terrible*;

So;
if (Is this world the
**best** possible world?)
  Pessimistic
  *Yes, unfortunately*;
else
  Positve
  *No, we can be better!*;

<img src="/images/code2flow_845e1.svg" alt="Understanding that this world is the best is pessimistic" class="img-med"/>

This just struck me and I wanted to write about it. I'm interested in anyone elses opinion though?
