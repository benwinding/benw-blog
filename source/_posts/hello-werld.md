Dear Internet,

This blog has been started to help me with writing and expressing my thoughts and ideas about programming. I've always valued coding blogs that I stumble across in google, so this site is also to give back to the enormous community that I've learnt from.

## Blog Goals

1.  Add a little to the internet
2.  Show off what I'm learning
3.  Improve writing skills

<!-- more --> 

## Development Cycle

 }
}
```

## Conclusion

That should answer a few questions that you didn't have, let me know in the comments if this sucks ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
