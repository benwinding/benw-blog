We ordered a pizza from a new pizza place in Adelaide. It seems like we discovered a thing called a Delivery-Only resturant ...

### Discovering the pizza store

We recently ordered a pizza from a new pizza shop called *Hey Bianca*. My partner Ally discovered them online *(via Instagram cause we're hip!)*, she then ordered the pizza from their website. However she noticed that there was no phone number visible on the website, and know way to contact the store, which seemed a little strange. But they stated they do pickup, so I was intending to pick up the pizza on the way home from work.

### Finding the store

I looked at the website and at first glance, I was not able to easily find the location of this pizza store. This was pretty odd, as it was a modern website for a pizza store, and one of the main reasons you search a business up is to find it, right?

On a closer inspection, I found the location at the very bottom of the page. It was not highlighted and seemed as if it was placed there for legal reasons. This intrigued me, so I set off to find the Pizza Shop!

### Spotting the store

I remembered the highly branded advertisements we found on Instagram, so I looked for these logos on the street. Big pizza signs or lights, but I couldn't easily see the store. 

After driving past it twice (It was raining, I'm dumb), I finally noticed that the pizza place was a tiny shop without any traditional signs.

It was weird that the small sign blocked the door (which was actually locked). But when I looked through the window I could see why. The entire Pizza Shop was actually just a big kitchen! So there was no room for customers to order or wait inside.

Well I knocked on the door and a chef came up to window and started talking to me. He said they're entire business is online-based and that pickup was only a courtesy for some customers in apartments in the area. They apologized that I couldn't come in, but I happily waited on the street until my pizza was ready, then took it home to Ally.

This got me thinking about the motivation and model behind this business...
