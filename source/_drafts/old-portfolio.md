# Projects

Professional projects I have completed during my professional development.

## [Design For Manufacture and Assembly](https://web.archive.org/web/20130725053831/http://www.benwinding.com/portfolio/university-projects/28-university-cad-projects#DFMA%20of%20Radio%20Controlled%20Car)

In third year engineering we studied Design For Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) and were given the task of redesigning a product to be manufactured and assembled easier. We chose an ambitious project that was an radio controlled car, the Hobao Hyper 8 rtr.

Project Highlights:

*   Over 400 components modeled using the CAD system, Inventor.
*   50% components made redundant.

## [Design, Fabrication and Installation of Art Sculpture](https://web.archive.org/web/20130725053831/http://www.benwinding.com/portfolio/industry-projects/54-design-fabrication-and-installation-of-sculpture#content)

I was given the opportunity to manage an entire project; the design and fabrication of a steel sculpture commissioned by the Art Gallery of South Australia. I worked with the client in designing the product using CAD, organizing the fabrication and finally the installation of the sculpture.

I learnt very valuable skills during this project as I had the opportunity to be involved in all areas of the manufacturing life cycle. Effectively I was the Estimator, Drafter, Project Manager and Supervisor for the project and as a result I learned that projects are dynamic and projects managers have to anticipate problems at every stage of the process.

Project Highlights:

*   Entire assembly modeled on the CAD system, Inventor.
*   Scheduled using MS Project.
*   Successfully installed at the Art Gallery of South Australia.

## [Cooperative Humanoid Robots](https://web.archive.org/web/20130725053831/http://www.benwinding.com/portfolio/university-projects/40-final-year-project#content)

My last year of university I choose to research cooperative humanoid robots. I developed different routines using the Bioloid Premium Development Kit. 

Project Highlights:

*   Wireless communication to central controller.
*   Synchronised routines.
*   Sensory inputs.
*   Cooperative Concepts.

## [CNC Milling Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130725053831/http://www.benwinding.com/portfolio/robotic-projects/42-diy-cnc-milling-machine#content)

In my second year of Engineering I decided to build a CNC milling machine from scratch (almost).

I bought 3 stepper motors and a 3-axis CNC controller. Threaded rod was used as the lead screw and a cheap variable speed router was used as the tool.

Project Highlights:

*   Total cost: $ 500
*   Cutting area: 1.2 m x 1.2 m
*   Anti-backlash system
*   0.5mm precision

## [Drawing Robot](https://web.archive.org/web/20130725053831/http://www.benwinding.com/portfolio/robotic-projects/43-drawbot-the-drawing-machine#content)

In my third year of engineering my interests changed from programming and virtual modeling to the more practical applications of programming which is micro-controllers and robotics.

After researching many other similar projects, I decided to begin my own project of creating a hanging wall drawing robot.

Most manufacturing devices have a limited workspace. However this machine has the ability to change the printing envelope to any size wall, as all you need to do is move the pulleys.

Project Highlights:

*   2.5 Axis CNC
*   Raster image sketching
*   Vector path following
*   Infinite adjustable print sizing
