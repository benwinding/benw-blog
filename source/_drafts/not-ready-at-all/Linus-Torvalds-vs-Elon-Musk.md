# Linus Torvalds
## Description
- Age: 48
- Rarely says "I"

## Quote
{% blockquote Linus Torvalds - 2016 %}
I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan, I don’t have a moon shot. I’m an engineer. I’m perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying, “I want to go there,” but I’m looking at the ground and I want to fix the pothole that’s right in front of me before I fall in.
{% endblockquote %}

The quote almost seems to be a direct reference to Elon Musk's quest to colonize the planet Mars. The point Torvald's is making is that the future is good to plan for, but I'm going to fix the problems we have now. This is something I appreciate.


## Linus?
However, the general public does not know who Linus Torvalds is. Yet his impact is arguably much greater. 

This is what annoys me most about his perception, but simultaneously makes me respect him even more. 

# Actual Impact
Linus developed Linux an Open-Source operating system, which the public is able to _use, modify and distribute_ without any cost, as long as changes are fed back to the project. Although it's a boring project, it's effect on the world is almost immeasurable;

- Servers
- Mobile phones
- Desktop computers 
- Almost any other type of micro processor



# Discussion
They seem to almost be diametrically opposed.
