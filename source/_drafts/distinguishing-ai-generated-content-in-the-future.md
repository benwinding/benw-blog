AI-generated content has never been easier, now anyone can create reasonably high-quality articles and images and host them online. This incredible technology has sparked several questions for the future of the internet:

- What makes AI-generated content different?
- How can we determine who is human online?
- What does this mean for privacy in the future?
- Humans can still use these tools and pass content off as though they themselves created the content too

## Bots will be ubiquitous

With this incredible technological revolution in writing, it will become easier and easier to make incredibly convincing AI personalities online.

This means proving you're *not a bot* will become harder and harder. And there's many changes that will probably begin to happen:

### Text - an untrusted source

This is already happening as people use this technology to quickly generate tonnes of articles and content online, masquerading as blog/company. People don't trust articles on random websites anymore.

## The end of human-written media?

It's not unthinkable to imagine that in the future, the only way to determine if content is coming from a living human, is to physically be next to them speaking/writing it.

All content would be increasingly be doubted as AI-generated, which can seem like a bleak future. But I personally believe that the positive of this future, is that articles and comments will be judged on the content rather than who said it...

The great thing about Reddit/Hacker News is that the user is a footnote, the content that they write is what's important.

## Personal Cryptographic Signatures

Articles and written content like reviews and comments could be signed with a verified signature that proves that a certain individual wrote it.

This doesn't prevent an AI from using the system, another more manual verification would need to be used to prove that signature is only used by a human.


## Privacy vs Humanity

Given 2 blocks of text one from a human and one from an AI, it's becoming harder and harder to determine which one was written by a real human.

It's clear that proving you're a human on the internet is getting increasingly difficult with advancements in AI.

A problem with this is that you will need to prove more and more that you are a specific individual online, rather than it being implied. This means things like your IP address, geo location and various other systems will be used to track you in order to prove your identity online.


## Karma System

Platforms like Reddit use a Karma system to determine the authenticity of a user. This means over time you can be more certain that a given user is real.

AI could defeat this as bot users could be written to simulate users and get karma over time.

## AI Filters to detect AI

This type of tool was originally used for plagiarism in education. Basically the content is passed into another AI which makes a guess whether the content was written by a human or not.

The flaws in this approach are immediately obvious, as it's trivial to paraphrase content with AI and it seems like an unwinnable arms race that AI will inevitably win.
