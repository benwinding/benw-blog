Hackers - as viewed by the general public - are a mysterious group of people. It's the uncertain definition of the word hacker and secretive nature of the culture which makes it so interesting. But how does a person find themselves becoming a hacker?

{% blockquote [1] Hayden Walles %}
What is generally called "hacking" today was originally called "cracking" in technical circles - as in cracking a safe. Hacking, in its original meaning, has nothing to do with malicious behaviour.

### There has to be a better way!
From my (limited) experience, the typical hacker is a person who is skilled with computers and is persistent in finding a way to accomplish a task. This person generally finds the status-quo unacceptable and may reciet the familiar mantra "There has to be a better way".

### Why does this do this?
This striving for something better may stem from the dis-satisfaction of what is currently experienced. For example; a hacker may begin his computing life on a Microsoft Windows computer. He is generally happy with his windows machine, until one day the computer begun it's automatic update routine. The would-be hacker was in the middle of a movie and missed the pop-up alert, and unfortunately during the final scene of the movie the computer suddenly shutdown and began updating. 

After 30 minutes of installing the Windows update, the hacker went back to his movie and tried to continue watching, but found him self annoyed at why the computer did that... it's this feeling that begin's the journey of many hackers into the rabbit hole of how-things-work and how-can-i-make-them-do-what-i-want.

### Mistrust is the root of all hackers
This journey ignited by mistrust is a burn most hackers can relate to. It's a  can be summarised in a few different ways:

- My machine can't run this program, how can I make it.
- How does this
