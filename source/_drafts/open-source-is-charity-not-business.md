I love open-source, I use many open-source tools and applications, I've written a handful of random libraries and projects. Everything I'm about to say is a bit of a rant, that's intended to help clarify my personal perspective on the best form of open-source development.

## The common perception

Lately I've begun to notice an interesting sentiment in the Open-Source community from people who see the _usage_ of Open-Source projects as being detrimental to the projects, like leaches who use and don't give back.

This YouTube comment perfectly describes this perspective:

## Hello FOSS world

On the surface, it looks simple and unfair... Some poor developer (like me) builds a little project and shares it with the world, then a giant company adds that to their product and makes billions off, without giving a single penny to the developer :(

But this is reductive, incomplete and is quite frankly damaging to attributes that make open-source good...

## The unfathomable amount of FOSS

It's easy to forget the big picture on where each project sits in the open-source ecosystem, especially when trying to determine an idea of _fairness_... The truth is, "all software development" relies on an **unfathomably large amount of open-source effort**.

Countless libraries, tools, languages, specifications, hardware, protocols and the history of all their development, all contributed to even the tiniest little library that a small time developer (like me) created. If this developer is to receive compensation, then shouldn't that developer give compensation to all the open-source stuff that they use too?

It's clear that we are all "standing on the shoulders of giants"

## But I want money!

So you want to contribute to the Open-source ecosystem, but also profit off of it? Okay then, there's a few hard questions to answer, and no I'm not going to search through your "*BESPOKE_LICENSE_V2.txt*"

- How much do I need to pay to use it?
- Does it matter if I'm a company or individual?
- Can I use it if I'm from a foreign country that's at war?
- Are there limitations on what the software can be used for?

These are all tricky questions which create various ethical concerns...

## The root of all Open-source business models

The primary motivation behind trying to charge money for the Open-source software is of course greed. People want to build something that generates money, so they can keep the lights on. Ironically, majority of "open-source businesses" would not give back even a fraction of the money that they made to other projects that they used...

## Open source is charity

Fundamentally, open-source is charity to the public domain, code for anyone to see and use. What's often forgotten is that once in the public domain, everyone can critique and mess with it. And if it's popular, many people will use it:

- Producers of FOSS don't owe consumers anything, they contribute for free
- Consumers of FOSS don't owe producers anything, they contribute & use it for free

In my opinion these are the core rules of great open-source software, it's essentially charity in both directions.

## Burnout is real though

There can be a lot of pressure on producers of FOSS software to fix things and respond to bugs etc... but **there is no obligation** to do so. If FOSS producers should want to step down from a popular project, then the project can (and should) just be handed-over or forked to willing maintainers.

## Notes

This is essentially saying that user's of an open-source project are obligated to contribute back to the project they're using, depending on the success of how they use the project.

It makes sense on the surface level... if Amazon is making 1 billion dollars in profit from using MySQL in some of their services, then they 

The thing is, that's the point of open-source... to give without expecting anything in return.

In my experience, anything else is terrible.

Your pricing conflicts with your open source users. You need them to build and improve the product but you also want them to have a worse experience otherwise your cloud-hosted solution will not prevail.
